/*
In the claimResource method, I've added synchronization to ensure that multiple threads won't access the pool
simultaneously, preventing race conditions. The method checks if there are available resources in the pool,
removes one if available, and returns it. If no resources are available, it returns null.

The releaseResource method is also synchronized to avoid potential issues with multiple threads trying to release
resources simultaneously. It simply adds the released resource back to the pool.
