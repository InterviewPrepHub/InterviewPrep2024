/*
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights
of the buildings in the line.The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the
building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings
to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

Example 1:
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
