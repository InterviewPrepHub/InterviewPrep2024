/*
You are running a classroom and suspect that some of your students are passing around the answer to a multiple-choice
question disguised as a random note.

Your task is to write a function that, given a list of words and a note, finds and returns the word in the list that
is scrambled inside the note, if any exists. If none exist, it returns the result "-" as a string. There will be at
most one matching word. The letters don't need to be in order or next to each other. The letters cannot be reused.

Example:
words = ["baby", "referee", "cat", "dada", "dog", "bird", "ax", "baz"]
note1 = "ctay"
find(words, note1) => "cat"   (the letters do not have to be in order)

note2 = "bcanihjsrrrferet"
find(words, note2) => "cat"   (the letters do not have to be together)

note3 = "tbaykkjlga"
find(words, note3) => "-"     (the letters cannot be reused)


All Test Cases:
find(words, note1) -> "cat"
find(words, note2) -> "cat"
find(words, note3) -> "-"
find(words, note4) -> "baby"
